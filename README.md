# DrawToEditRaster
ESCI 2711 Major Project - using arcpy and python provides the user with an opportunity to edit raster with more ease
The functionality of the program is to make it easier to have a finished/colour raster layer or map layer. The way this is visioned is that after taking user input using mouse or a pen and apply the drawn property to the rest of the area. Similar to Ink to Shape. In a way, this is an “edit mode” especially for converting to raster files, more specifically when dealing with a pixel where multiple values overlap, the user can scribble their preferred colour corresponding to the value they want in which part of the pixel to edit the pixel value. This will be using update cursers from arcpy to work with raster and will output an edit raster layer or a new raster layer.

current problems: projections of raster onto python window, getting console and pygame window to work at seperate times
